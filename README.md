# Dicoding-Project-ML
In this project, I use dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datascientistanna/customers-dataset to build machine learning models using supervised and unsupervised learning approaches. 

The first step is to apply unsupervised learning techniques, specifically clustering, to generate labels or classes for the datasets. After getting the labels or classes from the clustering process, I will combine this information with the original dataset.

With the dataset already equipped with a label or class, I apply supervised learning methods, namely classification, to develop a model that is able to predict the class based on the existing features.
